# ML Texture Fix Summary

## Problem
The ML-styled textures were not showing up - instead, you were seeing red, yellow, and green colored planes as fallback.

## Root Cause
The CoreML model (`starry_night.mlpackage`) expects input as an **MLMultiArray** with shape `[1, 3, 256, 256]` (batch, channels, height, width), NOT a CVPixelBuffer. 

The previous code was attempting to pass a CVPixelBuffer to the model, which would fail during prediction, causing the style transfer to return `nil` and fall back to colored planes.

## Solution
1. **Created `toMLMultiArray()` extension** on UIImage to convert images to the correct MLMultiArray format:
   - Resizes image to 256x256
   - Extracts pixel data from CGImage
   - Converts to CHW (Channels-Height-Width) format
   - Normalizes pixel values to 0.0-1.0 range

2. **Created `toCGImage()` extension** on MLMultiArray to convert the model output back to a displayable image:
   - Converts from CHW format back to HWC
   - Denormalizes from 0.0-1.0 back to 0-255
   - Creates CGImage with proper color space and bitmap info

3. **Updated `applyStyleTransfer()` function** to use the new MLMultiArray-based approach instead of CVPixelBuffer

## What to Expect Now
When you run the app in the simulator, you should see:
- The model loading successfully
- 4 demo planes being created
- Style transfer being applied with the "Starry Night" artistic style
- Planes displaying the stylized textures instead of solid colors

## Testing
Run the app in Xcode and check the console output. You should see messages like:
```
[ImmersiveView] âœ… Converted to MLMultiArray: [1, 3, 256, 256]
[ImmersiveView] ðŸš€ Running model prediction...
[ImmersiveView] âœ…âœ… Model prediction completed successfully!
[ImmersiveView] âœ…âœ…âœ… Successfully generated styled texture!
```

If you still see colored planes, check the console for specific error messages that will help debug further.
